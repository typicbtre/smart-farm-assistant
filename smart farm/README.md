### Test Questions to Try
1. "What should I plant in spring?"
2. "How do I grow tomatoes?"
3. "Tell me about composting"
4. "How often should I water my garden?"
5. "What herbs are easy to grow?"

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Chatbot Not Responding
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Ensure `knowledge.js` is loaded before `script.js`.

### Issue 2: LocalStorage Not Working
**Solution**: Some browsers block localStorage in incognito mode. Test in normal browsing mode.

### Issue 3: User Preferences Not Persisting
**Solution**: Verify JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() are used correctly. Check for typos in localStorage keys.

### Issue 4: Messages Not Scrolling
**Solution**: Ensure `chatMessages.scrollTop = chatMessages.scrollHeight` executes after adding messages.

## üí° Development Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Get basic chat working before adding advanced features
2. **Test Frequently**: Test each TODO as you complete it
3. **Use Console.log**: Debug by logging values to browser console
4. **Read Comments**: All TODOs have helpful hints in the code
5. **Ask Questions**: If stuck, try asking AI assistants for help!
